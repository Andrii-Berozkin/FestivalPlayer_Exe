# FestivalPlayer_Exe
Repository with just an executables for 'FestivalPlayer'.

It has pretty much anything you need to just use the FestivalPlayer.
Somehow it properly works only as debug solution, so consider a slightly bigger size and perhaps a bit less of perfomance(I guess).

The only missing thing here is .pdb which stands for 'Programm Debug Data'. It's just too big for GitHub, but anyway should work fine without.
